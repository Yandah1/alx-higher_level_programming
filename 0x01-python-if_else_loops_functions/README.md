This README provides a summary of several programming exercises. 
Each exercise has a specific task and set of rules to follow. Below are the summaries for each exercise:

Exercise 1: Determine Positive or Negative Number

Description: This program assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed and prints whether the number is positive, zero, or negative.
Output Format:
"The number is [number], is positive" if the number is greater than 0
"The number is [number], is zero" if the number is 0
"The number is [number], is negative" if the number is less than 0
Exercise 2: Print Last Digit of a Number

Description: This program assigns a random signed number to the variable number and prints the last digit of that number.
Output Format:
"Last digit of [number] is [last_digit], and is greater than 5" if the last digit is greater than 5
"Last digit of [number] is [last_digit], and is 0" if the last digit is 0
"Last digit of [number] is [last_digit], and is less than 6 and not 0" for other cases
Exercise 3: Print Lowercase ASCII Alphabet

Description: This program prints the lowercase ASCII alphabet in a single line, without a new line character.
Constraints:
Use only one print function with string format
Use only one loop
No character storage or module import allowed
Exercise 4: Print ASCII Alphabet Excluding 'q' and 'e'

Description: This program prints the lowercase ASCII alphabet, excluding 'q' and 'e', in a single line without a new line character.
Constraints:
Use only one print function with string format
Use only one loop
No character storage or module import allowed
Exercise 5: Print Numbers in Decimal and Hexadecimal

Description: This program prints numbers from 0 to 98 in both decimal and hexadecimal formats.
Constraints:
Use only one print function with string format
Use only one loop
No number or string storage or module import allowed
Exercise 6: Print Numbers from 0 to 99

Description: This program prints numbers from 0 to 99 separated by ", " and ends with a new line character.
Constraints:
Use no more than 2 print functions with string format
Use only one loop
No number or string storage or module import allowed
Exercise 7: Print Different Combinations of Two Digits

Description: This program prints all possible different combinations of two digits in ascending order, separated by ", ".
Constraints:
Use no more than 3 print functions with string format
Use no more than 2 loops
No number or string storage or module import allowed
Exercise 8: Check for Lowercase Character

Description: This function (islower(c)) checks if a character c is lowercase and returns True if it is, or False if it is not.
Constraints: No module import allowed, and do not use str.upper() or str.isupper(). You can use ord().
Exercise 9: Print Uppercase String

Description: This function (uppercase(str)) prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
Constraints:
Use no more than 2 print functions with string format
Use only one loop
No module import allowed, and do not use str.upper() or str.isupper(). You can use ord().
Exercise 10: Add Two Integers

Description: This function (add(a, b)) adds two integers a and b and returns the result.
Constraints: No module import allowed.
These exercises cover various programming challenges, each with specific requirements to test and enhance your coding skills.
