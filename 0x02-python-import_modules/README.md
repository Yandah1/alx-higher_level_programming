Python - import & modules: Python Programming

Overview
This project consists of several Python programming exercises. Each exercise is described below along with the instructions to complete it.

Task 1: Add Function
Write a program that imports the add function from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition of 1 and 2.

Use the print function with string formatting to display integers.
Assign the value 1 to a variable called a and the value 2 to a variable called b.
Use these variables as arguments when calling the add function and printing the result.
Define a and b in two different lines (a = 1 and another b = 2).
Your program should print: <a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value> followed by a new line.
Task 2: Print Arguments
Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.

The output should include the number of arguments followed by "argument(s)" or "argument" (if the number is one).
If at least one argument is passed, your program should print one line per argument, including the position of the argument (starting at 1), followed by a colon, the argument value, and a new line.
Your code should not execute when imported.
Use the len(argv) function to determine the number of arguments.

Task 3: Calculator Functions
Write a program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, performs mathematical operations using variables a and b, and prints the results.

Avoid using the print function more than 4 times.
Define the value 10 for a variable called a and the value 5 for a variable called b.
Use these variables as arguments when calling functions (including print).
Call each of the imported functions and format the output accordingly.
The word calculator_1 should be used only once in your file.
Avoid using * for importing or __import__.
Your code should not execute when imported.

task 4: Sum of Arguments
Write a program that prints the result of adding all the arguments.

The output should be the result of the addition of all arguments followed by a new line.
You can cast arguments into integers using int().
Your code should not execute when imported.
Exercise 5: List Module Names
Write a program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module hidden_4.pyc (download it locally).

Print one name per line in alphabetical order.
Only print names that do not start with "__".
Ensure you are running your code in Python 3.8.x, as hidden_4.pyc has been compiled with this version.
Exercise 6: Variable Load
Write a program that imports the variable a from the file variable_load_5.py and prints its value.

Avoid using * for importing or __import__.
Your code should not execute when imported.
